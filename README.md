o2xdl is a definition language that allows you to define Object Oriented structures in XML.  see http://www.o2xdl.org/

CORE is the basic o2xdl specification: CORE defines a tree of o2x:object to represent complex data structures and to perform transformations on them. CORE is agnostic to the technology used to create the o2x:object tree.
